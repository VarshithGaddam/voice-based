 I play the Indian much. That would probably be one of the last things that I would play. I'm lumbered with the situation. I mean, I'm still, I'll be an ostracized, is it worth? I mean, it's silly things like, you know, for instance, they stopped me from doing the Disney Star Wars weekend. I used to love doing the Disney Star Wars weekends. And it was a lovely job to have every year doing the Disney Star Wars weekend. I wouldn't even Florida. And then, I mean, that's one thing which they put the block on. And other things have cropped up which they haven't, you know, or stopped me from doing.
