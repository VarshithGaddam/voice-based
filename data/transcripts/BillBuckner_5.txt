 I got a phone call from one of those late night TV, big shows, and the guys talking to me like, was I going to jump off the bridge or shoot myself? I mean, and I'm thinking, what is there something here that I'm missing for somebody to have the balls to say that to me? I mean, that really ticked me off.
